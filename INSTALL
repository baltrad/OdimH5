Installation of OdimH5 software is driven by ant and requires several options
passed to the build script. The following options are required:

prefix :: installation prefix / target directory
hostname :: name of the host on which the installation is performed, preferably 
a domain name  
system :: operating system type, possible choices are 'linux' or 'win'
arch :: system architecture, possible choices are '32' and '64' 

Example of installation command:

$ ant -Dprefix=/home/odim -Dhostname=myhost.org -Dsystem=linux -Darch=64 install

In this case the software will be installed in linux/unix-type system under 
/home/odim directory using a set of 64-bit native libraries.
